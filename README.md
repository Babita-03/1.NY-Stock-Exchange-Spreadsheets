# NY-Stock-Exchange-Spreadsheets

**Project Overview**

In this project, we will analyze real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. We will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. During this project, I will conduct three tasks:

1.Complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings.

2.Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.

3.Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
